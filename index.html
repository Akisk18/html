    <li>School Thesis: Development of an educational tool for teaching the C programming language.<p>The aim of this thesis was to create a software that will be used by programming
        teachers. By modifying the software appropriately, teachers will be able to create
        exercises to assign to students for easier learning and understanding of various
        methods used in the C programming language for controling devices.
        The software is written in the C++ language and graphically illustrates two virtual
        arms that make movements (right, left, up, down, etc.) through functions that the
        students must call from their programms. The software runs through a virtual
        network created with sockets with TCP protocol and through client and server
        communication. By calling the appropriate function in student’s program, the arm wil
        do the desired movement.</p></li>
